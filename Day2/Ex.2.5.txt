When would the use of generators be preferred over list comprehension and vice versa:


When we would use List Comprehension :
- List comprehensions are enclosed in []
-When we need our code to be super fast with no delay
-If we have a large amount of resources
-When the result needs to be iterated over multiple times


When we would use Generator:
-Generators are enclosed in ()
-In expressions where the range is large or infinite
-When time is not paramount
-If resources are limited
